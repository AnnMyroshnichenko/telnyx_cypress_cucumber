# Cypress + Cucumber Automation Project for Telnyx website

## About

This repository contains an automated end-to-end UI testing project for the **Telnyx** website using **Cypress** and **Cucumber (BDD)**. The project follows Cypress best practices by organizing tests into reusable **Page Objects (POM)** and writing test scenarios in **Gherkin** syntax.

The automated tests verify key user journeys, including navigation, page content, calls-to-action, and other core website functionality.
